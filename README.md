Machine learning system to detect domain names which are likely generated by malware as randomized rendezvous points using
a supervised deep learning network. The Domain name, Origin and Target are encoded to categories before being fitted to numerical
values. To preserve the encoding scheme between the training and test set, the training set is saved to be used in category encoding
on new unseen testing set prior to inference.

A Dockefile is included. For example, to build a docker image, at the command line, type:
$ docker build -t dga .

To run compiled docker, at the command line, type:
$ docker run dga /code/dga_algorithm_detector.py -f testfile.txt:wq
